# smacofFlat
The smacof at https://www.github.com/deleeuw/smacofFlat combines R and C, trying
to use the strengths of both languages. 

This repository used to have an R front-end, calling four different other
R front-ends for metric/nonmetric weighted/unweighted
smacof MDS. These front-ends then called a corresponding
shared library (of four shared libraries) in which all computation was done. This
meant replicating a large amount of code four times, which seemed pretty wasteful.
But the resulting smacofSS() routine was 10-50 times as fast as smacofSym().

I have now simplified this to a single front-end smacofSS.R
which loads the single shared library smacofSS.so, in which
all the computation is done. The other major new characteristics 
remain the same: input (generated by R) is a sorted MDS data
structure, and there is only a single call in R to .C(),
which loads the library and passes the parameters. All output
and plotting is done by R routines again.

The basic C routine smacofSSEngine() uses ALS, implemented
in smacofSSMajorize() and smacofSSMonotone().
The approach is thus modular, which means it is easy to put together, for example, 
metric/nonmetric and weighted/unweighted versions of Sammon
Mapping, McGee Elastic Scaling, and pStress minimization. Just
swap out the majorization routine. I may actually do some of that.
